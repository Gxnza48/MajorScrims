# Note: The URLs above are placeholders. In a real scenario I would use the local paths provided by the user.
# Since I cannot access the local user uploads directly via URL in this script, I will assume the user wants me to use the files they uploaded.
# I will use the `copy` command in the shell instead of download script for local files.
